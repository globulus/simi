# Šimi - an awesome programming language

**Šimi's currently undergoing a major refit to boost its performance up to 100x (aka *project warp*). If you're interested in the old project, including Šimi server, Android and iOS features, [you can find it here](https://github.com/globulus/simi/tree/old).**

##### Please check out the [guides section](/guides) for in-depth info on the language and its features.

Do note that the guides are being updated as the language development progresses, and that they don't capture all the currently available features.

### Installation

* Download <warp_nacelles.zip>. Extract it to a location of your choice.
* Download <simi.sh> to a location of your choice.
* Open your *.bash_profile* or *.bashrc* and add the following lines to it:
```bash
export SIMI_HOME=YOUR_PATH_TO_SIMI_JAR #e.g ~/Documents/GitHub/simi/warp_nacelles/
source YOUR_PATH_TO_SIMI_SH # e.g ~/Documents/Github/simi/simi.sh
```
* Reload your terminal.
* Now you can invoke Šimi scripts from anywhere with `simi SCRIPT_FILE`.
